# C4C Challenge Fall 2024

## How to start the application:
- Make sure to have React, Express.js, and npm installed.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the application.

## High-level overview:
- Displays the name, logo, description, and active/inactive statys of C4C partner organizations.
- Allows the user to add new partner organizations.

## Design decisions:
- All content is arranged on one page, using partner tiles. The partner form is on a separate page with text-based inputs and a button to send it to the server.

## Reflection:
### What I learned:
- This was my first time working with both frontend and backend; in the past I have only done one or the other for projects.
### What I would have done differently with more time:
- Spend more time properly integrating the frontend and backend.
- Make the website look less basic.
### Issues:
- Most issues I ran into involved getting React and Express to work with each other. This resulted in me learning how to work with Express get and post endpoints from react components.
- I also ran into issues with information not being displayed at all on localhost. The solution to this was using a router and navigation buttons, which is something I had also used in a previous project.
